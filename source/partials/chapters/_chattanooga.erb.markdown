The Chattanooga chapter of Papers We Love

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas on an awesome academic/research paper with fellow programmers and paper-readers. Lead a session and help others share your interest in the field. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.
